# firebase_login
this android app is used for registering a mail with a password using firebase and then can login using them whenever they want to login

Here i have created an app that registers your mail with the password that assign it with
and stores the information in the firebase and later recollects the password to intended mail and login you into the app.

This app is pretty basic login app.
